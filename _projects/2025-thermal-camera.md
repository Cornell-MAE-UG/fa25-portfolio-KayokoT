This summer, I participated in the Thermal Energy Management on Multiple Scales REU at Washington University in St. Louis under the mentorship of Dr. Richard Axelbaum.

As part of the Staged Pressurized Oxy-Combustion (SPOC) Lab, I studied heat transfer and carbon-negative biomass combustion. My main project was researching, selecting, and validating a thermal imaging camera to monitor the system during operation. The provided website camera interface was not sufficient for our needs, so I developed a MATLAB script utilizing Modbus TCP protocol to optimize real-time camera alarm functions. I presented my results at the end-of-summer symposium and poster palooza.

In addition to this overarching project, I gained unique insight into the complexities of a start-up, as I helped the team refine their presentation to pitch SPOC to potential investors.
