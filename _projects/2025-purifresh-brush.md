As part of a semester-long group project, my team developed a 2-in-1 bottle and straw cleaner with a detachable brush head and ergonomic, folding handle. We iteratively went through the engineering design process to optimize our product. I was primarily in charge of the bill of materials and ordering necessary parts. 

We encountered many unforeseen challenges that led us to revamp our intial design of a brushhead that rotated with a u-joint. We found that the flexibility of the joint made the product harder to use, and was also prone to rusting. Utimately, we decided to move the joint higher in the brush stem, allowing for compact storage of the product while making it easier to use. Learning to navigate these setbacks as a team was critical to developing communication and teamwork skills, as well as learning the importance of designing for manufacturing, assembly, and sustainability.
